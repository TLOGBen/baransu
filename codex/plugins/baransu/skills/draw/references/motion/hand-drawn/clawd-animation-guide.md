# Animating Clawd

Read this whole file before you draw anything. It covers how to make a short, hand-painted cartoon, starring Clawd or any character you design: the rules and animation principles that make it look good, the workflow that catches mistakes, and the full reference for the character and the engine.

The person prompting you decides **what** the video is about. This guide decides **how** it's made. If they ask for something the rules below forbid (a caption, a 3D spin), do what they ask.

**No design here is final.** Clawd, the emotions, the props and the helpers are a starting point, not a limit. Change any of them, Clawd's own design included, and add whatever new characters, props or emotions the idea needs. Paint new things with the same tools and rules, so they belong with the rest.

## The three goals

Every rule below serves one of three goals.

- **Handmade.** The video should look like someone painted it by hand, frame by frame. That means brush strokes, ink lines that boil, flat 2D and no lettering.
- **Alive.** Something is always moving and something is always happening. Faces act instead of snapping, and characters are big enough to feel.
- **One piece.** It's one short film, not a pile of clips. Plan it before you draw it, and link every scene to the next.

Underneath all three, the viewer has to be able to follow it. Timing (rule 4) is the rule models get wrong most often.

## The rules

### 1. The medium is solid: brush strokes, flat 2D, boil

- **Paint everything with p5.brush through `paint()` and `inkLine()`.** Characters get flat `wash` colour plus an ink outline. Backgrounds get soft watercolour `fill` shapes, usually with no outline or a thin one. Never use plain p5 shapes (`rect`, `ellipse`, `fill()`): they look like 2000s Flash.
- **The linework boils.** `jit()` and `random()` are reseeded 12 times a second (`BOIL`), so every drawing wobbles slightly, like hand-drawn animation. That's the look; don't fight it. For anything that must stay put from frame to frame (star positions, tuft heights), use `hash(i)`. Give each separate element its own seed with `boilSeed(key)` (see Engine), or one moving thing makes everything drawn after it jitter.
- **Everything is flat 2D. Never project 3D.** Don't rotate a box in perspective, don't use `rotateY` or WEBGL 3D and don't fake depth with math. Clawd turns through **drawn key views** (front → 3/4 → side → back 3/4 → back), exactly like a cartoon model sheet: see `turn()` and `spinView()`. Depth comes from overlap, scale and colour (farther = smaller, bluer, paler), never from a projection.
- **Light is the one exception.** p5.brush mixes colour like pigment, so a yellow glow painted over blue turns green, and a thin wash over it turns grey. Use `glow()` for anything that shines: it adds real light, under the paper grain.
- **Soft palette, no pure black or white.** Use `PAL.ink` for black and `PAL.cream` or `PAL.paper` for white. Keep colours soft and harmonious, and keep Clawd clearly readable against the background.

### 2. No text

- **Show it, don't write it.** Models overuse text. No captions, no titles, no labels on objects, no signs, no speech bubbles with words, no words on screens, no "ZZZ" typed in a font.
- **Clawd's reactions are painted marks, never letters**: `!`, `?`, zzz, sweat, hearts, a bulb, a rain cloud. Use the emotes (see the reference).
- **A sign that repeats the story is the classic failure.** If Clawd holds a sign saying "I'm lost", the shot has failed. Show Clawd being lost: looking left, then right, the map upside down, a sweat drop.
- If the prompt truly needs a word (a name, a shop sign that is the joke), use `letter()`. Paint it into the scene, keep it to one or two words and use it once.

### 3. Something happens in every scene

- **Every shot needs an event:** something changes between its first frame and its last. Clawd wants something, finds something, tries, fails, reacts or gets it. "Clawd stands in a meadow being cute" is not a shot.
- **One focal action at a time.** Stage it with a clear silhouette and nothing competing for attention, so it reads at a glance.
- **Cause, then reaction.** When something happens, Clawd reacts to it: a take, an emotion change, a turn toward it. The reaction is often the funniest part, so give it time.
- **Pay it off.** Whatever you set up in a shot (a door, a sandwich, a strange noise) gets resolved on screen, in that shot or a later one.

### 4. Timing: model the viewer

Timing turns a set of drawings into a story. It's also where generated animation fails most often: everything moves at one brisk speed, events pile on top of each other, and moments are over before anyone understands them.

You know what happens because you wrote the code. The viewer doesn't: they see it once, at full speed, for the first time. **For every moment, ask what the viewer needs to understand and how long that will take them, and time it for that.**

- **Write the reads.** For each shot, list in order what the viewer has to understand. Each item is a *read*. Every read needs time for the eye to find it, time to understand it, and a moment to register before the next thing starts. Small, distant, fast or subtle things take longer to find and understand than big, central, obvious ones.
- **One read at a time.** Don't start a new read while the viewer is still taking in the last one. When two things happen at once, the viewer sees only one of them. Put a cause and its reaction in sequence, not on top of each other.
- **Fast actions, slow meanings.** A motion can be very quick if it's anticipated, but what it means needs held time. Anticipation tells the viewer where to look before the action, and the hold after it lets them understand it. Move quickly through what doesn't matter to the story, and spend time on what does. That contrast between quick and held is what gives a film rhythm; one constant speed, fast or slow, makes it flat and hard to follow.
- **Lead the eye.** The viewer looks at whatever moves, is bright, is big or is being looked at. Before an important read, get their eye to the right place (a character looks at it, the camera moves to it, it moves or lights up first), and give the eye time to get there.
- **Let the reads set the length.** A shot is as long as its reads need. A shot with many reads can't be short, and a shot whose reads have all landed shouldn't be padded. That includes the last shot: its final read needs time to land before the video ends.

For a worked example, see how the demo times its ending, at the end of this guide.

### 5. Alive

- **Nothing is ever still.** Every emotion has its own idle motion (`feel()`), cameras drift or push, grass sways, stars twinkle and the linework boils. A frozen frame reads as a bug.
- **Faces act, they never snap.** Change moods with `emotions()`. It does anticipation, a squint, a take and overshoot around every change. Never swap `eyes`/`mouth` by hand between two frames.
- **Move like a cartoon, not a machine.** Every move follows the animation principles in the next section.
- **Clawd is big.** In a medium shot, `u` is about 20–28 (Clawd is 10u wide, 8u tall). In a close-up it's 40–70. Tiny Clawds (u < 12) are for wide establishing shots only, and never for the whole video.
- **Everything moves on a beat.** `PROJECT.bpm` drives every idle, bounce and dance, so the whole film shares one pulse. Put the hits on beats (`pulse()`, `beatN()`), even with no music.

### 6. Transitions always

- **Every seam gets a transition:** into the first shot, between every pair of shots and out of the last one. Never start on a hard frame, and never just stop.
- **Pick a transition that belongs to the story**, and don't default to the same one every time. Some options:
  - a brush wipe (`brushWipe`)
  - an iris or shaped iris (`iris`, `irisShape`)
  - a whip pan with a smear
  - a match cut (the same shape or motion across the cut)
  - a cut on action (cut mid-move, and finish the move in the next shot)
  - a camera move that carries through into the next shot
  - a fade or push from paper or black
- A plain cut is fine only when it's on action or a deliberate smash cut.
- **Changes inside a shot are transitions too:** emotions go through `emotions()` and turns go through `turn()`. Props arrive and leave on arcs, never popping in.

### 7. One piece: a vision before any code

- **Storyboard first**, in writing, before you write any scene code (the workflow below has the format). If you're working with a person, show them the storyboard and let them react before you build.
- **One world.** Pick a palette and a setting that carries through, with a colour arc across the video (e.g. cold night → warm dawn as Clawd's mood lifts).
- **One thread.** The story has a beginning, a middle and an end, and Clawd's emotional arc follows it. Plan the emotion keys across the whole video, not per shot.
- **Rhyme the ending with the opening:** the same place, pose or motif, changed. It makes the film feel whole.
- **Link scenes:** motion continues across cuts, and screen direction stays consistent (if Clawd travels right, keep travelling right). Props and characters carry over.

## Animation principles

These are the classic principles of character animation, as they apply here. Most of them fix one problem: motion written as code comes out mechanical, because code moves every part at once, on the same curve, by the same amount.

- **Anticipation.** Before a big move, make a small move the opposite way: a crouch before a jump, a wind-up before a throw, a squint before a take. It tells the viewer something is coming and where to look. `jump()` and `emotions()` build it in.
- **Squash and stretch.** Bodies squash on impact and stretch when they move fast, keeping their volume (`sq`).
- **Slow in, slow out.** Almost nothing moves at a constant speed. Things ease out of one pose and into the next. A plain `lerp` over time looks mechanical, so run its progress through an easing (`ease`, `easeIn`, `easeOut`, `backOut`).
- **Weight.** How something starts and stops says what it weighs. Heavy things take longer to get going and to stop, and land with little bounce. Light things snap into motion, bounce and flutter to rest.
- **Arcs.** Living things move on arcs, not straight lines: thrown props, hops, arm swings, head turns (`arcPt`).
- **Overlapping action and follow-through.** Don't move every part at once. The eyes lead, the body follows, and arms, hats, props and tails drag behind, overshoot and settle last. Offset each part's timing a little from the one it hangs off (`spring`, `ring` and `backOut` for the settle).
- **Avoid twinning.** Code copies values, so both arms end up at the same angle, both eyes blink together and a crowd bounces in unison. Give one arm the action and the other something smaller, and offset timings, phases and `seed`s between characters.
- **Exaggeration.** Push poses, takes, squash and leans further than feels natural. In a short cartoon, subtle reads as nothing. If it looks like too much on the sheet, pull it back.
- **Strong key poses.** Each shot's storytelling poses should read as stills, with a clear silhouette and the body leaning into what it's doing, before any motion goes between them. If the key poses don't read, the motion won't fix it.
- **Show the thought.** A character notices, thinks, then acts, and the eyes move first. The viewer understands a choice when they see it being made.
- **Secondary action.** Small actions that support the main one (a hat bobbing, an emote popping, grass stirring) add life, but they never compete with it.

## Workflow

### 1. Storyboard

Write `STORYBOARD.md` before any scene code:

```
Logline: one sentence. Clawd wants ___, but ___, so ___.
World: setting, a small palette, light, how the colour changes across the video.
Motif: the thing that recurs and pays off.
Clawd's arc: the emotion keys across the whole video.
Shots:
  A  start–end  [transition in: ___]  what's seen · the EVENT · Clawd's reaction · camera
     reads:  start–end  the first thing the viewer must understand
             start–end  the next one (where is the viewer's eye when it starts?)
             ...
  B  start–end  [transition: ___]  ...
  ...
  [transition out: ___]
```

The reads are the timing sheet. Give each one a start and an end, make sure each has time to be found and understood, and make sure no two important reads overlap. If a shot's reads don't fit its length, lengthen the shot or cut a read; don't squeeze them.

Check the storyboard against the rules:
- Is there an event in every shot?
- Does every read have time to land before the next one starts?
- Is there a transition at every seam?
- Is there any text anywhere?
- Does the ending rhyme with the opening?

### 2. Build

Build and check one shot at a time, in order. Within a shot, block the key poses first and check them as stills; add the motion between them once they read. Every shot is a function of time with no state carried between frames (see `../pipeline.md`).

### 3. Look at it: the review loop

You can't see motion by reading code. Render and look at every shot, several times, at three zoom levels:

```bash
# contact sheet: the shape of the whole piece (every shot's first, middle and last frames)
node render.mjs --sheet=0.1,0.8,1.6,2.4,3.1,3.9 --cols=6 --w=320 --out=out/check/sheet.jpg
# strip: EVERY frame of a moment (turns, takes, jumps, throws, transitions)
node render.mjs --strip=2.1:2.6 --cols=6 --w=320 --out=out/check/strip.jpg
# crop: full-resolution detail (faces, hands, contacts, glows); crop=x,y,w,h in frame pixels
node render.mjs --sheet=2.3,2.4 --crop=760,420,500,400 --w=500 --out=out/check/face.jpg
# crop-at: the same, following a WORLD point through each frame's camera (a foot or a prop on a moving shot);
# x,y in world pixels (or an expression evaluated in the page), w,h in frame pixels
node render.mjs --strip=2.1:2.6 --crop-at=960,700,500,400 --out=out/check/feet.jpg
```

Open each image and actually look at it. Check:

- **Read:** is the event of each shot clear from its sheet alone? Is Clawd big enough, and does Clawd separate from the background?
- **Timing.** You can't judge timing from single frames, so read it like a viewer:
  - Render the shot as a sheet at a fixed step (every 0.1–0.15 s) and read it in order.
  - At each frame ask: where is the viewer looking right now, and do they understand it yet?
  - Count the frames each read gets (24 frames = 1 s). A read that flashes by in a few frames, or shares its frames with another read, will be missed.
  - After each important moment, is there time to take it in before the next thing starts?
- **Motion:** in strips, does every move have anticipation and follow-through? Are there any pops, jumps or snaps between frames? Do the parts move at different times, or all at once? Is anything moving at a constant speed, or mirrored left and right? Are the poses pushed far enough to read?
- **Boil:** in a strip, each pair of frames that share a boil drawing should match except where something moves. Anything still that changes every frame needs its own `boilSeed()`.
- **Contacts:** do feet touch the ground? Do held things touch the arm tips? Do thrown things leave from the hand?
- **Transitions:** check the first and last 0.5 s of every shot and every seam. Does it open and close with a transition?
- **Rules:** is there any text? Is there any 3D? Is there any dead stretch where nothing is happening?
- **Colour:** any muddy glows (use `glow()`), pure black or pure white?

Fix what you find, then look again. **Budget:** at least one sheet per shot, a strip for every key motion and transition, and a crop for every face that carries the story. Contact sheets run about 0.1–1 s per frame, so this is cheap: don't skip it.

### 4. Render

```bash
node render.mjs --clip --out=out/video.mp4                      # the whole video, straight to MP4
node render.mjs --frames --workers=4                            # or: parallel + resumable JPEG frames into out/frames …
node render.mjs --encode --out=out/video.mp4                    # … then encode them
```
